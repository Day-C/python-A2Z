#tuples are similar to lists but they are immutable(cant be changed after they are created). they are created uding parenthesses '()'
colors = ("black", "green", "blue", "yellow")

#tuplees can easily be converted to lists
tup = ([4, "men", 4])           # if we print tup output will be: (4, "men", 4)

list(tup)                       #tup is now a list: [4, "men", 4]

list("hello")                   #output: ['h','e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
