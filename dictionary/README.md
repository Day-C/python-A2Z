a dictionary is a mutable collection of many values. But unlike indexes for lists, indexes for dictionaries can use many different data types, not just intagers. indexes of dictionaries are called 'keys', and a key with its associated values is called a 'key-value pair'. 
in code a dictionary is types with braces, {}.
my_car = {'color': 'black', 'name': "ferrari", 'year': '2024'}
